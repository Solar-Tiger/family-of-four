            <p>In truth a family is what you make it. It is made strong, not by number of heads counted at the dinner
                table, but by the rituals you help family members create, by the memories you share, by the commitment
                of time, caring, and love you show to one another, and by the hopes for the future you have as
                individuals and as a unit.</p>
